# 🚀 Smart Contracts – Practice Projects

This repository is a space for developing and practicing smart contracts in **Solidity**.  
It contains contracts created throughout my journey of learning **blockchain** and **Web3**.

## 🛠️ How to Use

To compile and test these contracts, **Hardhat** is recommended.

```bash
# Navigate to the contract folder
cd path/to/contract

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile the contract
npx hardhat compile

# Run the tests
npx hardhat test
```
